# laravel-app-exercise
a Laravel application that helps a user understand how much quantity of a product is available for use.

## App Description  
- The application displays an interface with a button and a single input that represents the requested quantity of a product.
- When the button is clicked, the interface shows either the $ value of the quantity of that product that will be applied, or an error message if the quantity to be applied exceeds the quantity on hand.
  - Note that product purchased first will be used first, therefore the quantity on hand should be the most recently purchased.
